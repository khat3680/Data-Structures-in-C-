Case 1: formatting cIntro.txt:

C is an imperative 
procedural language. It was 
designed to be compiled 
using a relatively straightforward 
compiler. It provides low-level 
access to memory. It 
provides language constructs that 
map efficiently to machine 
instructions. It requires minimal 
run-time support.
----
Case 2: formatting chistory.txt:

C is a general-purpose, 
imperative computer programming language, 
supporting structured programming, lexical 
variable scope and recursion, 
while a static type 
system prevents many unintended 
operations. By design, C 
provides constructs that map 
efficiently to typical machine 
instructions, and therefore it 
has found lasting use 
in applications that had 
formerly been coded in 
assembly language, including operating 
systems, as well as 
various application software for 
computers ranging from supercomputers 
to embedded systems. C 
was originally developed by 
Dennis Ritchie between 1969 
and 1973 at Bell 
Labs, and used to 
re-implement the Unix operating 
system. It has since 
become one of the 
most widely used programming 
languages of all time, 
with C compilers from 
various vendors available for 
the majority of existing 
computer architectures and operating 
systems. C has been 
standardized by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
since 1989 (see ANSI 
C) and subsequently by 
the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO).
